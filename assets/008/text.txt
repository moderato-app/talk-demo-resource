If your dad enjoys smoking, there are a few gift options you could consider:

1. Cigar or pipe set: A high-quality cigar or pipe set can be a great gift for someone who enjoys smoking. Look for one that comes with a selection of cigars or a variety of pipe tools.

2. Smoking accessories: Consider gifting your dad some smoking accessories like a cigar cutter, lighter, or ashtray. These can be practical and stylish additions to his smoking routine.

3. Subscription to a smoking club: There are various smoking clubs that offer monthly subscriptions. Your dad could receive a curated selection of cigars or smoking-related products each month, allowing him to try new items and enjoy his hobby even more.

4. Whiskey or wine pairing: If your dad enjoys pairing cigars with his drinks, you could consider gifting him a high-quality bottle of whiskey or wine. This would complement his smoking experience and provide a well-rounded gift.

Remember to consider your dad's specific preferences and tastes when making your choice.
